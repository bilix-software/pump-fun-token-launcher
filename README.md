# Pump.fun Token Launcher

New: There is now also a telegram bot available for my [bundler]([https://nodejs.org/](https://github.com/bilix-software/pump-fun-bundler)) at: https://t.me/viper_pump_bot.  Note: this is a first version so any feedback is appreciated.

This repository provides tools and scripts for programmatically launching `pump.fun` tokens. The project is set up using TypeScript and includes essential modules to facilitate token creation and management.
Some information to perform the launch transaction successfully has been redacted, contact me at info@bilix.io if you're interested.

A showcase of this launcher can now be used on: https://viper.bot
For a fee you can use this bundler to launch a token with your own buys.
It contains the following features:
  - Bundle launch with up to 16 buy transactions
  - Enter mint privatekey to ensure mint ends in pump
  - Buying and Selling
  - Sell single wallet by percentage
  - Sell all wallets completely through Jito Bundle
